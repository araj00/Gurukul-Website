                            and spiritual Saint voluntarily and spending his life with an intention to make people free from
                            evil clutches of negative influence of present era by maintaining the gesture of Sacrament in
                            Society. He started his journey as a saint at very early age of life in the Swaminarayan Mandir
                            located in Bhuj where he had spent 17 Years.
                            Swamiji says a Gujarati proverb “Sadhu to Chalta Bhala” which is implemented in his whole
                            journey of life. In 1985, Swamiji left Bhuj Swaminarayan Temple and arrived to Swaminarayan
                            Temple, Kalupur. After serving few years there Swamiji did Mahantai at Shree Swaminarayan
                            Temple, Narayanpura-Ahmedabad where he arranged Satsang Khathas in the surrounding towns and
                            villages which has given enlightenment to many followers. By the humble order of Acharya
                            Maharajshri, Swamiji moved to Shree Swaminarayan Mandir, Siddhpur. After development of Siddhpur
                            Temple Swamiji came to Kalol, an entrance of North Gujarat Region and acquired a piece of barren
                            land and dreamed to establish a gurukul providing education, shelter to helpless peoples and a
                            Gaushala.
                            The first foundation stone was laid down by Param Pujya Dharm Dhurandhar 1008 Acharya Shri
                            Tejendraprasadji in the year 1992. Thereafter, Swamiji continued Satsang, Kathas and religious
                            meetings in the nearby Towns and Villages. Then initially started giving education to few
                            students. Swamiji had started a School, then gradually he established various educational
                            institutes like B.Ed., PTC, Pharmacy, Diploma-Degree-Masters Engineering in Kalol campus. Then
                            he established another branch of SSVG in Ranip-Ahmedabad where International School and
                            Physiotherapy institute were started. To provide quality health care facility Swamiji has
                            started hospital in Kalol campus followed that Medical and Paramedical courses have been
                            started. Moreover, through Swamiji’s vision Swaminarayan University came into existence from 1st
                            June, 2022. Swamiji strongly believes that an institution’s true strength lies in the hearts and
                            souls of its teachers and students who come together with a purpose and firm determination to
                            exchange the knowledge and let the whole society be the beneficiary.

Swamijij has dedicated his life as religious and spiritual Saint voluntarily and spending his life with an intention to make people free from evil clutches of negative influence of present era by maintaining the gesture of Sacrament in Society. He started his journey as a saint at very early age of life in the Swaminarayan Mandir located in Bhuj where he had spent 17 Years. 
                            Swamiji says a Gujarati proverb “Sadhu to Chalta Bhala” which is implemented in his whole journey of life. In 1985, Swamiji left Bhuj Swaminarayan Temple and arrived to Swaminarayan Temple, Kalupur. After serving few years there Swamiji did Mahantai at Shree Swaminarayan Temple, Narayanpura-Ahmedabad where he arranged Satsang Khathas in the surrounding towns and villages which has given enlightenment to many followers. By the humble order of Acharya Maharajshri, Swamiji moved to Shree Swaminarayan Mandir, Siddhpur. After development of Siddhpur Temple Swamiji came to Kalol, an entrance of North Gujarat Region and acquired a piece of barren land and dreamed to establish a gurukul providing education, shelter to helpless peoples and a Gaushala. 
                            The first foundation stone was laid down by Param Pujya Dharm Dhurandhar 1008 Acharya Shri Tejendraprasadji in the year 1992. Thereafter, Swamiji continued Satsang, Kathas and religious meetings in the nearby Towns and Villages. Then initially started giving education to few students. Swamiji had started a School, then gradually he established various educational institutes like B.Ed., PTC, Pharmacy, Diploma-Degree-Masters Engineering in Kalol campus. Then he established another branch of SSVG in Ranip-Ahmedabad where International School and Physiotherapy institute were started. To provide quality health care facility Swamiji has started hospital in Kalol campus followed that Medical and Paramedical courses have been started. Moreover, through Swamiji’s vision Swaminarayan University came into existence from 1st June, 2022. Swamiji strongly believes that an institution’s true strength lies in the hearts and souls of its teachers and students who come together with a purpose and firm determination to exchange the knowledge and let the whole society be the beneficiary.
